# Solo Project - Unit Converter

## About the Project

This is a solo JS project I built, given just a design spec and the information for three mathematical unit conversions. 

## What I put into practice:

- DOM manipulations
- adding an event listener with multiple nested functions
- template strings and innerHTML
- passing parameters into functions
- input.value
- CSS design with multiple divs

## Reflection

I became more confident as I built this app in one sitting, creating simple yet dynamic functions with real world applications. I made the design choice to deviate slightly from the [given spec](https://www.figma.com/file/cqtGul0V8RFXY4vTcIv1Kc/Unit-Conversion?node-id=0%3A1) in how I represented the unit conversions, because I found the conversions more readable when presented on separate lines. As someone is neurodivergent, this was a more accessible design choice, even though it pushed each conversion section into two lines.

Within this choice, I also learned to make my code slightly more efficient by consolidating DOM manipulations. I originally had two separate ID's I was referencing in each conversion section, but realized I could consolidate them into a single ID, then use innerHTML to still retain the paragraph text on two separate lines.

Last but not least, though Scrimba has been mostly having me use getElementById when manipulating the DOM, with this project I became to use querySelector instead, as I've learned it is more precise and dynamic.
